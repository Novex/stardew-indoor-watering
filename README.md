# Indoor Watering mod for Stardew Valley

This is a mod that makes sprinklers water all plots indoors, not just in greenhouses (like inside cabins when using the [Farmhouse Plots mod](https://github.com/JessebotX/StardewValleyMods/tree/master/.ContentPackMods/%5BCP%5D%20Farmhouse%20Plots)). It also offers the option to rain indoors as well (including the greenhouse), kind of like opening a skylight I guess?

This mod supports multiplayer and should only need to be installed on the host.

## config.json
```
{
  "sprinkleInside": true,
  "rainInside": false
}
```

| Command | Description |
|--- |--- |
| sprinkleInside | Should sprinklers work on farm plots inside buildings? |
| rainInside | When it's raining outside, should it also rain on farm plots inside buildings? |
